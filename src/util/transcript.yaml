      <@${slackId}> it's been 10 minutes since you've left the call, and i don't see any ships from you!!

      i'm going to wipe your time for this session - remember, it doesn't count unless you ship something after you leave the call :rac_pf: 

      _remember, a ship needs to have an image attached to count, and must be something you've done in that huddle session - some examples:_
      - _i made player movement in my game!_
      - _i made it so my bot responds to my messages_
      - _i added and wired up some decoupling capacitors on my schematic :3_
  update_reminder:

      <@${slackId}> hey- _hey_!! it's been an hour without you posting anything... are you still alive?? mind giving me a scrap to feed off of so i have the motivation to get you your next cup? :rac_wtf:

      post a picture of what you're working on in channel to give me a scrap!!

      i'm going to be pausing your time until you post it!!
  afk_timeout:

      <@${slackId}> you good there? it's been _two whole hours_, and i haven't seen you move!! 

      going to boot you from this place to make room - next time, remember to post scraps of what you've been making into the channel :racpf: 

      if you're here to yap, that's fine too, just remember to use /yap when you're on, so that it doesn't track your time!!

      <@${slackId}> leaving? that means it's time to make a ship post of what you've done in the session :rac_woah: 

      *post in channel what you've done while on huddle, with an attached image!*
      
      if you accidentally left, join back the huddle in the next 10 minutes for me to resume your time :rac_wtf: 
      you _must_ make a ship post, or none of the time you just huddled for will be counted!

      `twitch,, twitch!!` welcome to the #cafe!!

      get your cafe mode _ON_, and let me show you around!!

      first things first: join #cafe-bulletin!! this is where everything important is posted :rac_woah: 

      what do you actually do in this cafe??
      join the huddle!!
      post in channel what personal project you're working on
      every hour you hack, i'll bring you a :cup: cup!! 
      after you're done, leave the huddle, then ship what you did that session by posting in channel with an image! (demo links also appreciated)

      want to just join the huddle and yap? use the `/yap` command to do so, once you join the huddle! 

      that's it! if you have any questions, feel free to post them in this channel :rac_shy: enjoy your stay!!

  inactivity:
    - "it's been 10 minutes since you've joined! since you didn't post your initial scrap, i thought you were inactive, so i stopped tracking your time! rejoin and try again."

      <@${slackId}> it's been 10 minutes since you've left the call, and i don't see any ships from you!!

      i'm going to wipe your time for this session - remember, it doesn't count unless you ship something after you leave the call :rac_pf: 

      _remember, a ship needs to have an image attached to count, and must be something you've done in that huddle session - some examples:_
      - _i made player movement in my game!_
      - _i made it so my bot responds to my messages_
      - _i added and wired up some decoupling capacitors on my schematic :3_
  update_reminder:
    - | 
      <@${slackId}> it's been 45 minutes since you joined the huddle, and i haven't seen any scraps from you! i need to see at least one scrap from you per hour, or i'll assume you've gone afk and wipe your time. 

      _a scrap is a update post on your project, attached with an image_ :rac_info: 
  afk_timeout:
    - |
      <@${slackId}> you good there? it's been _a whole hour_, and i haven't seen you move!! 

      going to boot you from this place to make room - next time, remember to post scraps of what you've been making into the channel :racpf: 

      if you're here to yap, that's fine too, just remember to use /yap when you're on, so that it doesn't track your time!!

  yap:
    no_scrap:

        just chilling? that's fine!
        i stopped tracking your time, but if you wanna start hacking again while on call, run `/hack`!

    final_scrap:

        seems like you're done with hacking! 

        make a ship post of what you've done in the session :rac_woah: and i'll count your time!
        *make sure you attach an image to your ship!*

        otherwise, feel free to stay and yap with us :3
